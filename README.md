## _General info_

DiceGame is a single page application simulating a random dice roll for two players. Each time the page is refreshed, an animation "imitating" the rolling of the dices, and after 2 seconds, the final result shows the information which player won or whether there was a draw ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯ . I used HTML5, CSS3 and pure JavaScript.
